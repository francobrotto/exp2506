Barclays bank branches in England and Scotland have been covered in red paint and had windows smashed as part of protests by a pro-Palestine group.

Up to 20 buildings have been targeted, according to the group Palestine Action.

It said the protests were carried out to ""demand the bank divests from Israel's weapons trade and fossil fuels"".

A spokesperson for Barclays said: ""While we support the right to protest, we ask that campaigners do so in a way which respects our customers, colleagues and property.‚Äù

In Bristol, the windows of a city centre branch of Barclays Bank were smashed and red graffiti sprayed over the building.

Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, rocks inscribed with the names of Palestinians killed in the conflict were thrown at a Barclays building, the protesters said.

City of London police said three men, aged between 34 and 45, had been arrested in connection with criminal damage at the Barclays on Moorgate on Monday morning.

It is one of several branches in the capital to have been targeted.

Among them were ones in St John‚Äôs Wood, north London, Croydon, Richmond, south-west London, and Peckham and Croydon in south London.

Meanwhile, branches in Stockport and Bury, both in Greater Manchester, and Preston, Lancashire, have been adorned in red paint and damaged.

The protesters also struck in Glasgow, Brighton, Exeter, Sheffield, Northampton, Birmingham and Solihull, Palestine Action said.

Shut the System, a recently launched underground climate movement, partnered with Palestine Action's underground division to launch the attacks, both activist groups confirmed.

According to the groups, targeted actions will continue until Barclays stops investing in certain companies.

A spokesperson for Barclays said the bank ""provides vital financial services to US, UK and European public companies that supply defence products to NATO and its allies"".

""The defence sector is fundamental to our national security and the UK government has been clear that supporting defence companies is compatible with ESG considerations,"" the spokesperson added.

""Decisions on the implementation of arms embargos to other nations are the job of respective elected governments.‚Äù

During its 7 October attacks in southern Israel, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took some 251 people hostage.

Some 116 remain in the Palestinian territory, including 41 the army says are dead.

What does it mean?‚Å£‚Å£

And I think that question is important to answer, among the controversy, the differing opinions and the disruption. For me, it means using my voice to let my fears and hopes live out. The disruption is minor to what we could face in the not-so-distant future and that's scary. But in all honesty, I still can't truly grasp it. Even when I read the statistics and sit and cheer on a strong and passionate community of like-minded people, I'm still unsure of what it all really means and what my voice is doing.‚Å£‚Å£

Protests were widespread, in leafy Tunbridge Wells, in Leicester, Chelmsford and Chipping Norton. Hundreds filled the streets of Manchester and Birmingham, with song and theatre in Glasgow and Brighton, to Bridgwater and beyond. 

Together, these XR local groups rocked the insurance world, delivering a clear message: stop enabling fossil fuels, respect human rights and support a just transition.

What‚Äôs not to like? Insurers can sway the course of history because without their help the fossil fuel criminals can‚Äôt dig for coal in Cumbria, drill for oil and gas or build pipelines like EACOP.

XR joined with other groups, including @coalactionuk, @tippingpointuk, @climatejustice_coalition, @britishquakers, @mothersriseup, @stopeacop and @just.stopoil to drive home the point that insuring fossil fuel projects is a risky business, and companies can help save the world if they refuse cover.

Hallam, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, has been sentenced to five years in jail.

The other four were given four year sentences by Judge Christopher Hehir.

He said: ‚Äö√Ñ√¥The plain fact is that each of you some time ago has crossed the line from concerned campaigner to fanatic.

‚Äö√Ñ√≤You have appointed yourselves as sole arbiters of what should be done about climate change.‚Äö√Ñ√¥

Court ruling regarding Drax Protest:

Today activists gathered outside Leeds Crown Court to support Axe Drax activist ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Coffee‚Äö√Ñ√π, they were being sentenced after previously been found guilty of a non violent protest action which saw her climb on the roof of a train en-route to Drax power station. 

In the ruling, she was told to pay ¬¨¬£3,000 and given a conditional discharge. She could have been sent to prison for up to two years for the protest that occurred on the 11th of November 2021.

Walking free outside the court, the activist joined the gathered crowd with placards with various messages regarding the controversial use of burning wood by Drax, a Biomass power station in North Yorkshire, that burns wooden ‚Äö√Ñ√∫pellets‚Äö√Ñ√π as an alternative to coal.

Activists previously had stated that Drax burns 6.5 to 7 million of these Pellets each year, equivalent according to their figures 14 million tons of wood. They state this wood is mainly coming from the US or Canda.

With such large wood usage they state there is grave concern about the startling amount of deforestation required to fulfil this demand and questions have been raised about the sustainability of wood Drax uses, including in an official OfGem (Energy Regulator) investigation.

BBC‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Panorama stated Drax ‚Äö√Ñ√∫took timber from rare forests in Canada it had claimed were no-go areas‚Äö√Ñ√π

Drax stated in response to Panorama that its wood pellets are ‚Äö√Ñ√∫sustainable and legally harvested‚Äö√Ñ√π.

Today, thousands of people from different organisations returned to Westminster in the morning to support the #LondonMarathon, handing out leaflets to spectators and cheering on the runners. We are #RunningOutOfTime to act, but we are making ourselves impossible to ignore.

Throughout the day there were more fantastic speeches and workshops, including: A talk on mental health in the context of the CEE and PCSC Bill at the Planetary Health Hub; a service led by young people at the Faith Hub; a poetry workshop for young people co-led by Writers Rebel at the Global Justice Now tent; a Climate Cafe at the Planetary Health Hub; and exciting speeches and bands on the Main Stage! There was something for everyone to get involved with.

In the afternoon, people took part in the Big DIY Assembly, an exercise in deliberative, participatory democracy and collective decision making.

After the Big DIY Assembly, thousands of people marched to the Home Office with handmade pink paper boats to stand in solidarity with migrants and to protest against the government‚Äôs Illegal Migration Bill. There were some very moving speeches, including one from a young Algerian man who crossed the channel on a small boat, sharing his experiences and his hopes for the future.

We are uniting to survive, and it is beautiful. Tomorrow is the final day of #TheBigOne, so make sure you‚Äôre there.

COP26 COLLIDES WITH A PLANT-BASED FOOD SYSTEM ON WORLD VEGAN DAY

Last week we took our message straight to the government to demand a plant-based future. Now it's time to take to the streets at COP26. 

Today marks the first day of COP26 where world leaders will come together to make decisions that affect us all. We know that we can't rely on the government to choose our planet and all life over profit. If we are to see the changes we need to face the climate and ecological emergency, we need to take action.

What is Aerogel?

Aerogels are the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lightest (least dense) solids. They are also excellent thermal insulators and have been used in numerous Mars missions and the Stardust comet particle-return mission.

How was it created?

Back in 1931, a guy named Professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles Learned. Now the bet revolved around jellies, like peanut-butter-and-jelly jellies.

Now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids. I mean, they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re mostly liquid, but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s embedded within this 3D solid structure. So if you think of a gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity, and then that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s about 1% of the gel.

So the bet was this:

Could you remove the liquid from the jelly? Without affecting the solid structure? I mean, if you just evaporate the liquid out, well, then the solid structure shrinks, because as you remove liquid molecules, they pull on each other, and they pull on the solid structure around them, basically crumpling it from the inside.

Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways. First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say, water, for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high-pressure vessel called a autoclave, by heating it to the high-temperature, high-pressure point called the critical point of the liquid, that liquid transformed into a semi-liquid, semi-gas called a supercritical fluid.

At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas. Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other.

So once you‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve depressurized the vessel, that solid skeleton, that 1% of the mass of the gel, is left behind intact, except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas, and that solid skeleton, that nano porous solid is what we call aerogel.

This discharge of electricity creates a bright flash of light and a powerful sound wave we hear as thunder.

Each year, lightning causes thousands of wildfires, damages homes and infrastructure, and tragically results in injuries or loss of life.

Chris Packham says:
‚ÄúThis is a terrible start to a process that‚Äôs critically important to our future as a country. We need a radical overhaul of a broken food system that‚Äôs not helping farmers, making people ill and punishing our environment. 

‚ÄúIf massive factory farmers are being given a seat at the table and sustainability and health experts marginalised, this process could be holed below the waterline from the outset.‚Äù

I support Palestine Action‚Äô in Parliament Square today, with others expected to take part in later actions across the UK.

Expressing public support for Palestine Action is now a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act following the group‚Äôs proscription by home secretary Yvette Cooper. It is the first time anti-terror law, designed to ban groups like Al Qaida and Isis, has been used to designate a domestic, non-violent direct action group a terrorist organisation. 

The action, organised by Defend Our Juries, aims to challenge that proscription. Further such actions are set to take place in Bristol, Manchester and Cardiff. An independently organised demonstration is also being held in Derry, and one man took ‚Äòsolo action‚Äô by posing with a sign in the market town of Kendal in Cumbria. 

Bill, a 76-year-old university lecturer, told Novara Media he was participating in the London action because he disagreed ‚Äúwith this government‚Äôs definition of a terrorist‚Äù. ‚ÄúI might as well call you a red bell pepper, and now you have all the legal rights of a red bell pepper,‚Äù he said. Asked how he felt about the prospect of a charge under the terrorism act, he replied, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all an adventure.‚Äù

In a letter to the Home Secretary, the groups said ‚Äú We will not be deterred from opposing genocide, nor from defending those who refuse to be bystanders. The British public is against you and your genocide. They are against the corruption of democracy and the rule of law by the Israeli government, Elbit Systems, and the arms industry.‚Äù

Ahead of the action, Defend our Juries wrote to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley alerting him to the action. Last week, 29 people were arrested, held for 12 hours then released without charge. Among them were an 83-year-old priest and a human rights lawyer.

In the letter, the group urged Rowley not to enforce the law around Palestine Action‚Äôs proscription, accusing the commissioner of ‚Äò acting here as the private security for the partners to a genocide, the ultimate crime‚Äô.

This statement affirms our solidarity with Palestine Action in their campaign against proscription, and with the organisers of the national demonstrations for Palestine who are also being dragged before the courts. We all share their goal of ending the flow of weapons from Britain to Israel.

Whether we achieve that aim through civil disobedience, or strikes to halt weapons deliveries, mass protests outside arms factories or marches through city centres, boycotts, divestment campaigns and encampments, our movement will decide that for itself.

Regenerative agriculture plays a crucial role in tackling climate change. The science is clear that nature-friendly farming practices can contribute significantly to both climate change mitigation and food security. 

As nature-friendly farmers, we're proud to be part of the solution.

Policymakers should include aid to help farmers make this transition - here in the UK and across the world.

Defra released the UK‚Äôs Total Income from Farming (Tiff) figures for 2024 on Thursday (5 June).

The data reveals significant declines in wheat, barley, and oilseed rape output and value, driven by prolonged wet conditions during crucial planting periods, saturated soils, and poor harvest yields.

Harvest wheat production dropped by 20.3% to 11.1m tonnes ‚Äì the lowest since 2020 ‚Äì due to an 11% reduction in planted area and a 10.4% fall in yields.

Wet conditions in the winter and spring limited both the quantity and quality of wheat crops.

Income from wheat alone fell sharply by ¬£796m (27%) to ¬£2.16bn. Barley income decreased by ¬£190m (14.1%) to ¬£1.16bn, while oilseed rape dropped ¬£149m (30.8%) to ¬£335m.

Wheat prices in 2024 also declined from the elevated levels seen in 2022 and 2023, influenced by the easing of supply disruptions from the Ukraine-Russia conflict.

The average price of UK breadmaking wheat was ¬£238.64/t, down 9.6% compared to 2023.

The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) said Defra‚Äôs data validates its earlier warnings that worsening extreme weather events are eroding farming incomes and threatening long-term food security.

‚ÄúFarmers are now counting the cost of climate change,‚Äù said Tom Lancaster, a land and food analyst at the ECIU.

‚ÄúWith another challenging harvest likely this summer due to heat and drought, farming‚Äôs financial resilience is being pushed to the limit.‚Äù",FALSE

The plans for this massive incinerator in Canford, Wimborne, have been refused by BCP Council, a facility that threatened Canford Heath SSSI, raised air traffic safety concerns with its 110m chimney, and would have pumped toxic plumes over homes, schools & nature.

Environmental activists and farmers may seem unusual allies, but a group is preparing to bring a bright pink tractor to a London demonstration demanding urgent action on climate change.

Inspired by the Extinction Rebellion pink boat, which blocked Oxford Circus in central London for five days during April, a team of farmers has painted a John Deere tractor an eye-catching colour to share positive farming messages with the public.
