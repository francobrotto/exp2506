Barclays bank branches in England and Scotland have been covered in red paint and had windows smashed as part of protests by a pro-Palestine group.

Up to 20 buildings have been targeted, according to the group Palestine Action.

It said the protests were carried out to ""demand the bank divests from Israel's weapons trade and fossil fuels"".

A spokesperson for Barclays said: ""While we support the right to protest, we ask that campaigners do so in a way which respects our customers, colleagues and property.”

In Bristol, the windows of a city centre branch of Barclays Bank were smashed and red graffiti sprayed over the building.

Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, rocks inscribed with the names of Palestinians killed in the conflict were thrown at a Barclays building, the protesters said.

City of London police said three men, aged between 34 and 45, had been arrested in connection with criminal damage at the Barclays on Moorgate on Monday morning.

It is one of several branches in the capital to have been targeted.

Among them were ones in St John’s Wood, north London, Croydon, Richmond, south-west London, and Peckham and Croydon in south London.

Meanwhile, branches in Stockport and Bury, both in Greater Manchester, and Preston, Lancashire, have been adorned in red paint and damaged.

The protesters also struck in Glasgow, Brighton, Exeter, Sheffield, Northampton, Birmingham and Solihull, Palestine Action said.

Shut the System, a recently launched underground climate movement, partnered with Palestine Action's underground division to launch the attacks, both activist groups confirmed.

According to the groups, targeted actions will continue until Barclays stops investing in certain companies.

A spokesperson for Barclays said the bank ""provides vital financial services to US, UK and European public companies that supply defence products to NATO and its allies"".

""The defence sector is fundamental to our national security and the UK government has been clear that supporting defence companies is compatible with ESG considerations,"" the spokesperson added.

""Decisions on the implementation of arms embargos to other nations are the job of respective elected governments.”

During its 7 October attacks in southern Israel, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took some 251 people hostage.

Some 116 remain in the Palestinian territory, including 41 the army says are dead.

The news coverage of it all made me think back to Monday (15th April), during the take-over of Piccadilly, and how the Extinction Rebellion team asked us a question; how does the Rebellion live inside of you? What does it mean?⁣⁣

And I think that question is important to answer, among the controversy, the differing opinions and the disruption. For me, it means using my voice to let my fears and hopes live out. The disruption is minor to what we could face in the not-so-distant future and that's scary. But in all honesty, I still can't truly grasp it. Even when I read the statistics and sit and cheer on a strong and passionate community of like-minded people, I'm still unsure of what it all really means and what my voice is doing.⁣⁣

What’s not to like? Insurers can sway the course of history because without their help the fossil fuel criminals can’t dig for coal in Cumbria, drill for oil and gas or build pipelines like EACOP.

XR joined with other groups, including @coalactionuk, @tippingpointuk, @climatejustice_coalition, @britishquakers, @mothersriseup, @stopeacop and @just.stopoil to drive home the point that insuring fossil fuel projects is a risky business, and companies can help save the world if they refuse cover.

Court ruling regarding Drax Protest:

Today activists gathered outside Leeds Crown Court to support Axe Drax activist ‚ÄúCoffee‚Äù, they were being sentenced after previously been found guilty of a non violent protest action which saw her climb on the roof of a train en-route to Drax power station. 

In the ruling, she was told to pay ¬£3,000 and given a conditional discharge. She could have been sent to prison for up to two years for the protest that occurred on the 11th of November 2021.

Walking free outside the court, the activist joined the gathered crowd with placards with various messages regarding the controversial use of burning wood by Drax, a Biomass power station in North Yorkshire, that burns wooden ‚Äúpellets‚Äù as an alternative to coal.

Activists previously had stated that Drax burns 6.5 to 7 million of these Pellets each year, equivalent according to their figures 14 million tons of wood. They state this wood is mainly coming from the US or Canda.

With such large wood usage they state there is grave concern about the startling amount of deforestation required to fulfil this demand and questions have been raised about the sustainability of wood Drax uses, including in an official OfGem (Energy Regulator) investigation.

BBC‚Äôs Panorama stated Drax ‚Äútook timber from rare forests in Canada it had claimed were no-go areas‚Äù

Drax stated in response to Panorama that its wood pellets are ‚Äúsustainable and legally harvested‚Äù.

Today, thousands of people from different organisations returned to Westminster in the morning to support the #LondonMarathon, handing out leaflets to spectators and cheering on the runners. We are #RunningOutOfTime to act, but we are making ourselves impossible to ignore.

Throughout the day there were more fantastic speeches and workshops, including: A talk on mental health in the context of the CEE and PCSC Bill at the Planetary Health Hub; a service led by young people at the Faith Hub; a poetry workshop for young people co-led by Writers Rebel at the Global Justice Now tent; a Climate Cafe at the Planetary Health Hub; and exciting speeches and bands on the Main Stage! There was something for everyone to get involved with.

In the afternoon, people took part in the Big DIY Assembly, an exercise in deliberative, participatory democracy and collective decision making.

After the Big DIY Assembly, thousands of people marched to the Home Office with handmade pink paper boats to stand in solidarity with migrants and to protest against the government’s Illegal Migration Bill. There were some very moving speeches, including one from a young Algerian man who crossed the channel on a small boat, sharing his experiences and his hopes for the future.

We are uniting to survive, and it is beautiful. Tomorrow is the final day of #TheBigOne, so make sure you’re there.

A Quote From Extinction Rebellion

🚨UK FOOD STRATEGY IGNORES CLIMATE IMPACT 

DEFRA Food Strategy has met with leading figures across the food system to advise on its food strategy - no environmental groups were represented at all.

In a world where food shortages are already impacting the most vulnerable, climate impact is key to food strategy. 

That’s why Scientists for the Extinction Rebellion Page have joined together demanding…
PEOPLE AND PLANET OVER PROFIT 

Chris Packham says:
“This is a terrible start to a process that’s critically important to our future as a country. We need a radical overhaul of a broken food system that’s not helping farmers, making people ill and punishing our environment. 

“If massive factory farmers are being given a seat at the table and sustainability and health experts marginalised, this process could be holed below the waterline from the outset.” 

✊More than 12,000 objections and a 43,000 signature petition were submitted in opposition to the UK government’s plan.

I support Palestine Action’ in Parliament Square today, with others expected to take part in later actions across the UK.

Expressing public support for Palestine Action is now a criminal offence under the Terrorism Act following the group’s proscription by home secretary Yvette Cooper. It is the first time anti-terror law, designed to ban groups like Al Qaida and Isis, has been used to designate a domestic, non-violent direct action group a terrorist organisation. 

The action, organised by Defend Our Juries, aims to challenge that proscription. Further such actions are set to take place in Bristol, Manchester and Cardiff. An independently organised demonstration is also being held in Derry, and one man took ‘solo action’ by posing with a sign in the market town of Kendal in Cumbria. 

Bill, a 76-year-old university lecturer, told Novara Media he was participating in the London action because he disagreed “with this government’s definition of a terrorist”. “I might as well call you a red bell pepper, and now you have all the legal rights of a red bell pepper,” he said. Asked how he felt about the prospect of a charge under the terrorism act, he replied, “it’s all an adventure.”

In a letter to the Home Secretary, the groups said “ We will not be deterred from opposing genocide, nor from defending those who refuse to be bystanders. The British public is against you and your genocide. They are against the corruption of democracy and the rule of law by the Israeli government, Elbit Systems, and the arms industry.”

Ahead of the action, Defend our Juries wrote to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley alerting him to the action. Last week, 29 people were arrested, held for 12 hours then released without charge. Among them were an 83-year-old priest and a human rights lawyer.

In the letter, the group urged Rowley not to enforce the law around Palestine Action’s proscription, accusing the commissioner of ‘ acting here as the private security for the partners to a genocide, the ultimate crime’.

An autonomous grouping of disenfranchised students, have today entered into occupation inside the building of Guild of Students, UoB for the duration of the NUS Lead and Change conference. 

The NUS’ have long failed to represent student interests and has not been a genuinely progressive force for decades, as evidenced by the revolving door from the Presidency of NUS into the Labour Party, with many former presidents now responsible not just for the continuation of austerity, but also for the Government inaction to properly respond to the Genocide in Gaza. 

Our occupation will last for the duration of the Lead and Change conference. They instead, will hold the Birmingham Student Assembly, an alternative programme of events will run inside the occupation for students and activists to engage in politics free from the confines of NUS’ suppression.

In the video, which has since gone viral, a woman can be seen spraying red paint on the painting before using a sharp object to slash open the canvas of the Lord Balford painting.

Lord Arthur James Balfour was the former prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905.

In 1917, while serving as the foreign minister, he wrote the Balfour Declaration, which is a letter endorsing establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine.

The declaration, which endorsed establishing a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, not only increased popular support for Zionism
around the world, but helped pave the way for the eventual creation of Israel.

Palestine Action, a British protest network that aims to dismantle the UK’s complicity in Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians.

The group said the Balfour Declaration “paved the way for ethnic cleansing” of people in Palestine.

“He gave away the Palestinians homeland — a land that wasn’t his to give away,” it said in a press release.

Pointing to the ongoing war in Gaza, the group said Britain’s support “for the continued colonization of Palestine hasn’t wavered since 1917”.

It pointed out that Elbit Systems, Israel’s biggest weapons manufacturer uses Britain as a manufacturing outpost to build arms which are “battle-tested” on Palestinians.

The group said that it will continue to protest until Elbit is shut down and British complicity with the colonization of Palestine ends. (📹:

Let’s talk about why boycotting certain companies is so important to support Palestine. 

I get it - it’s ‘just a coffee or a burger’. But it’s not just that. It’s about where our money goes and what it supports. 

Some of the biggest global brands have deep financial ties to Israel, through investments, partnerships or operations in illegal settlements. 

That means part of what you spend on a Frappuccino or a Big Mac could be helping fund the occupation of Palestine. 

Palestinians have asked us to boycott. It’s not about hate - it’s about non violent resistance. It’s how we, as ordinary people, can show solidarity when governments stay silent. 

And boycotts work. It helped end apartheid in South Africa. It pressures companies to change, to take a side, or loose the support of an entire generation. 

So yeah, maybe skipping that brand seems small. But when millions of us do it together? That’s power. 

Every purchase is a choice. 

Every euro is a vote. 

Use yours to stand for justice. 

Stand with Palestine 🇵🇸",,FALSE
